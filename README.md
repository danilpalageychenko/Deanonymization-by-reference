In order for the definition of ipv6 to work, you need to configure on ipv6 hosting you can take (teredo / miredo) and in the file "index.php" in line 86 replace ipv6 address with your own.





http://"ip" - The address on which the script is running, can be shortened by any abbreviation of links

http://"ip"/log.txt - View report by IP addresses
